# Foursquare API Project
This is a class project for Advanced Business Application by Amir Sodefi and myself (Krisha Shrestha).
This project utilizes FourSquare and Google Maps API to give venue recommendation to users.
This project was done entirely using Python.

We also created a webpage using HTML and CSS that explains the project, how the application works, the codes and the data analysis performed in the project.
